## Separation of Concerns in Software Design

The principle is simple: donâ€™t write your program as one solid block, instead, break up the code into chunks that are finalized tiny pieces of the system each able to complete a simple distinct job.


### SoC for programming functions

If we take the lowest level (the actual programming code), SoC instructs us to avoid writing long complex functions. When the function starts to bloat up in size, this is the red flag that the method is possibly taking care of too many things at once.

## Cohesion and Coupling

The application of the Separation of Concerns involves two processes: reduction of coupling and increasing cohesion.
